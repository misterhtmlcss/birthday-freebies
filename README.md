The goals of this app are:

Currate a list of businesses that offer freebies to customers on their birthday.
Then to communicate that list a week, then 12 hours before your birthday and then finally the morning of your birthday. All so you don't forget about your free options that day.

I always think hey the next day I can go for my birthday whatever, but today it's free free. I like free and I think there is nothing wrong with enjoying what others are willing to freely give on that day.
