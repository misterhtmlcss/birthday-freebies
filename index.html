         <p>We don't do anything with your email address. What we do is we keep it in a database and 7 days before your birthday we send out 3 emails a year; 7 days before your birthday, then the night before and in the morning at 7am.</p>
         <p>Why do we do this? Well because it solves a bunch of issues that have arrisen from my own experience from already having confirmed plans elsewhere to forgetting about a place on the day of e.g. Denny's Grand Slam which is why I created this service originally</p>
