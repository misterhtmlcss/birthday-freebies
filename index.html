</head>
<body>   
   <h1>Want to get all the free stuff you can on your birthday?</h1>
   <p>Yes? Well so do I!!</p> 
   <form action="#"> 
      <Subscribe>Email Address</Subscribe>
      <date>Have a birthday picker - Just Day and Month</date>
      <timezone>We need to detect and confirm their timezone for emails</timezone>
      <submit>Button</submit>
   </form>
   <p>We don't do anything with your email address. What we do is we keep it in a database and 7 days before your birthday we send out 3 emails a year; 7 days before your birthday, then the night before and in the morning at 7am.</p>
   <p>Why do we do this? Well because it solves a bunch of issues that have arrisen from my own experience from already having confirmed plans elsewhere to forgetting about a place on the day of e.g. Denny's Grand Slam which is why I created this service originally</p>
